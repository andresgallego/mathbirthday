# Mathbirthday

A "math birthday" is a date that is 10^n days after the day they were born. On your first math birthday you are 10 days old, and on your second you are 100 days old, and on your third you are 1000 days old, which is almost 3 years old, etc.

The interface is very simple. There is a calendar for selecting your birth date, and the page shows your next upcoming math birthday. For example, if your birth date was 3 days ago, it would say "Your next math birthday is your 10-day-old birthday on X date," where X date is a the number of days from now. If your birth date was over 2 years ago, it would say "Your next math birthday is your 1000-day-old birthday on Y date" where Y date is maybe a couple hundred days away in the future.
